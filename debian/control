Description: Hierarchical view of the machine - contrib plugins
 libhwloc provides a portable abstraction (across OS, versions,
 architectures, ...) of the hierarchical topology of modern architectures. It
 primarily aims at helping high-performance computing applications with
 gathering information about the hardware so as to exploit it accordingly and
 efficiently.
 .
 libhwloc provides a hierarchical view of the machine, NUMA memory nodes,
 sockets, shared caches, cores and simultaneous multithreading. It also gathers
 various attributes such as cache and memory information.
 .
 libhwloc supports old kernels not having sysfs topology information,
 with knowledge of cpusets, offline cpus, and Kerrighed support
 .
 This package contains plugins to add discovery support for non-free items. This
 includes
  - CUDA support.
  - nvctrl support.
