<h1>CPU Binding and Memory Binding </h1>  </div>

<div class="contents">
<p>Some OSes do not systematically provide separate functions for CPU and Memory binding. This means that CPU binding functions may have have effects on the memory binding policy, and changing the memory binding policy may change the CPU binding of the current thread. This is often not a problem for the application, so by default hwloc will make use of these functions when they provide better binding support.</p>
<p>If the application does not want any CPU binding change when changing the memory policy, it needs to use the HWLOC_MEMBIND_NOCPUBIND flag to prevent hwloc from using OS functions which would change the CPU binding. Conversely, HWLOC_CPUBIND_NOMEMBIND can be passed to cpu binding function to prevent hwloc form using OS functions woudl change the memory binding policy. Of course, this will thus reduce hwloc's support for binding, so their use is discouraged.</p>
<p>One can however avoid using these flags but still closely control both memory and CPU binding, by allocating memory and touching it, and then changing the CPU binding. The already-really-allocated memory will not be migrated, thus even if the memory binding policy gets changed by the CPU binding order, the effect will have been achieved. On binding and allocating further memory, the CPU binding should be performed again in case the memory binding altered the previously-selected CPU binding.</p>
<p>Not all OSes support the notion of a current memory binding policy for the current process but those often still provide a way to allocate data on a given node set. Conversely, some OSes support the notion of a current memory binding policy, and do not permit to allocate data on a given node set without just changing the current policy and allocate the data. Hwloc provides functions that set the current memory binding policies (if supported) as well as functions which allocat memory bound to given node set. By default, it does not use the former to achieve the latter, so that users can use both on OSes where they are both supported, and get both effects at the same time. For convenience, hwloc however also provides the hwloc_alloc_membind_policy and hwloc_alloc_membind_policy_nodeset helpers which are allowed to change the current memory binding policy of the process, in order to achieve memory binding even if that means having to change the current memory binding policy. </p>
